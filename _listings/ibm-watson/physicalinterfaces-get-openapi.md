  title: IBM Watson IoT Platform Query active phyiscal interfaces
  description: |-
    Physical interfaces are used to model the interfaces between physical
    devices and the Watson IoT Platform.  A physical interface references
    event types.  Devices that implement a physical interface publish these
    events to the platform.

    The event types are referenced via a mapping that maps an event id to
    the id of an event type.  The event id corresponds to the MQTT topic
    that the event is published to by a device.

    The **physicalinterfaces** endpoint returns the list of all of the
    active physical interfaces that have been defined for the organization
    in the Watson IoT Platform.  Various query parameters can be used to
    filter, sort and page through the list of active physical interfaces
    that are returned.
